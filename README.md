This repository includes a collection of Web and API scrapers that extract information pertaining to historical performances of the New Year's Concert by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra from the (https://www.musikverein.at/archiv)[Web archive of the Musikverein], the venue of the concert series; and, information pertaining to commercial recordings of concerts in the series, from Spotify's Web API. 

The scrapers produce output as Linked Data in RDF (Turtle) format. The R script that is also included in this repository analyses this data, conducts some simple exploratory analysis, and generates visualisations such as these:
